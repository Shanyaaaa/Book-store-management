This is a basic Book Store Management System built with React enables users to perform essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a collection of books.
Users can add new books with details like title, author, and price, view a list of all books, update book information, and delete books as needed. 
The UI is built using React components, while data handling is typically managed using state or API calls to a backend server.
